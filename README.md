Godville Viewer for SailfishOS

Godville is a massively-multiplayer zero-player game (ZPG). The gist of Godville is that it is a parody on everything from "typical" MMO games with their tedious level ups to internet memes and ordinary day to day things appealing to a wide audience.
In this app you can see information about Godville heroes. Just enter your godname and choose the server (Russian language — godville.net, English language — godvillegame.com). You don't need to know password.
English-language server players can only see basic information about heroes, like names or levels. Russian-language server players can see continually updated info like current health, quest progress and more. For this they should set the checkbox 'Оперативные данные в API' (Operational data from API) in the profile.
Also note that the information updates only for about one hour from your last login to the site.
